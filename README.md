# Work-Squad Roster

## Purpose
For this challenge, I wanted to create a website for a client that allows them to oraganize their employees in to a roster comprised of cards with each employee's information. From the command like, when node index.js is types, a series of questions will be presented to the user. The user will be able to put in information for a manager and after prompted if they'd like to add an engineer or intern. After all the employees have been added, an index.html file will be generated. 

## Built With:
*HTML
*CSS
*Bootstrap
*JavaScript
*Node.js
*Express.js
